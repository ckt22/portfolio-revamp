### Portfolio Revamp

I am in fact using a template named Gatsby London, which gives me a basic understanding how GraphQL and SSG technique works. Please check out this awesome work at https://jamtemplates.com/templates/gatsby-london. And of course, I added some final touches to make it look more like a software engineering portfolio rather than a fancy blog. Anyway, big shoutout to Imed (the creator) for this amazing work!
