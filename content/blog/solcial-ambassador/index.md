<p>I regard myself as a blockchain, crypto and web3 enthusiast, while I am also a strong advocate of free speech and decentralization. Solcial catches my attention with their content hosting methodology with a P2P network to make sure the content is not manipulated, as well as the tokenomics that grants content creator their personal token used for subscription to premium content. Backed by large corporates like Alameda Research and Solana Ventures, along with the very attractive tokenomics, I am looking forward to the launch of this SoFi project.</p>

<h2>Content Management</h2>

<p>As Solcial would like to gain traction across the globe, we would definitely need multilanguage blogs introducing the vision and mission of the platform. Coming from Hong Kong, I helped with translating and proofreading content to Chinese.</p>

<h2>Community Engagement</h2>

<p>Just like any other web3 project, it is crucial to maintain an active and freidnly community. I am proud to be one of the Solcial scouts, responsible for answering questions raised by other members in Discord. I am also actively participating in discussions among the team to provide feedback on project development.</p>
